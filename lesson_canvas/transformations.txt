2D/3D Computer Graphics has 4 basic transformations:
- translation or moving origin to given coordinates (x, y)
- scaling or stretching the axis by given amounts (this will scale everything,
including coordinates, line widths, heights, bitmap pixels etc. Note:
negative scaling will do mirroring)
- rotation or rotation around the origin (0, 0)
- skew

The typical order is:
1. translation
2. scaling
3. rotation
4. drawing

All these transformations can be combined in 2D graphics into 3x3 matrix, where
the lower line is always 0 0 1, so there is actually only 6 numbers, which can
do all the above mentioned translations and their combinations. So all
transformations can be efficiently done by just doing one multiplication 
3x3 matrix.

In 3D graphics the matrix is 4x4, and the lowest row is always 0 0 0 1.
